The composition of the proposed unit is presently in dispute.
By way of brief background, on or around August 6, 2020, Teamsters Local 317 (the “Union”) filed a petition for representation of “full & part-time Cycle Counter (inventory control)” employees located at the Employer’s Syracuse, New York warehouse.  The Employer understood this unit to be comprised of its three Cycle Counter employees.  The Union first made the Employer aware of its desire to include an Inventory Control Coordinator in the proposed unit after the Employer’s deadline had passed to submit a position statement where the Employer could challenge the composition of the bargaining unit.  An election was subsequently held on September 9, 2020, where the Employer challenged the ballot of the Inventory Control Coordinator.  That challenged ballot was not sufficient to alter the outcome of the election, so the Employer did not have further opportunity to challenge the Inventory Control Coordinator’s inclusion in the proposed unit.  The Employer has consistently disputed the Inventory Control Coordinator’s inclusion in the unit due to insufficient community of interest and because the position was not clearly identified in the representation petition.  The Union continues to identify the Inventory Control Coordinator as a represented member of the bargaining unit. Accordingly, this unit clarification petition is filed to obtain a determination as to the appropriate scope of the bargaining unit."
